It doesn't look that great, but I had a little fun doing it and it's a bit cheaper than a pre-built remote and receiver.

Overall, it functional but if your goal is to make a RC plane then you should just buy pre-built one. And of course, you can adapt it to other wireless devices, because of course, it's made with Arduino.

**The disadvantage is that it looks ugly and the receiver is quite larger than the pre-made one.
